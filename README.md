## Usage

The React Data Grid component provides the following functionalities:

* Displaying existing data: The component takes an array of objects as input, where each object represents a row in the grid. The properties of each object correspond to the column names.

* Editing data: Clicking the "Edit" button allows you to modify the data in a row. The changes are saved when the "Save" button is clicked.

* Adding data: Use the input fields at the bottom of the grid to add new rows. Click the "Save" button to append the new data to the grid.

* Deleting data: Click the "Delete" button to remove a row from the grid.

Make sure to handle the storage of data in your application. The component utilizes local storage to persist the changes made to the data.
